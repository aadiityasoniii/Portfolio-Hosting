# Portfolio Site Deployment with Netlify

Welcome to the guide for deploying your portfolio site using Netlify! This README will walk you through the process step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
- A portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A GitHub account to host your website's source code.
- An account on Netlify.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork this Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

      git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git


3. **Customize Your Portfolio**: Personalize the content, design, and layout of your portfolio according to your preferences. Add your projects, showcase your skills, and make it truly reflect your identity as a developer.

4. **Push Changes to GitHub**: Once you're satisfied with your changes, push them to your GitHub repository:

      git add *
      git commit -m "Updated portfolio content"
      git push origin master


## Deploying with Netlify

1. **Sign in to Netlify**: Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and sign in with your GitHub account.

2. **New Site from Git**: Click on "New site from Git" on the Netlify dashboard.

3. **Connect to GitHub**: Choose GitHub as your Git provider and authorize Netlify to access your repositories.

4. **Select Your Repository**: Search for and select your portfolio repository.

5. **Configure Build Settings**: Set the build settings as follows:
- Build command: `npm run build` or `yarn build` (if you're using a build tool like npm or yarn)
- Publish directory: `dist` or `public` (the directory where your built files are located)

6. **Deploy Your Site**: Click on "Deploy site" to deploy your portfolio to Netlify.

7. **Custom Domain (Optional)**: If you have a custom domain, you can easily add it in the Netlify dashboard under "Domain settings".

8. **Continuous Deployment**: Netlify automatically deploys your site whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Your portfolio site is now live and accessible to the world. Share the link with your friends, colleagues, and potential employers to showcase your skills and projects.

Happy coding!
